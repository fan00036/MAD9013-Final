					Introduced in 1992, the competition replaced the Super Champions League's Cup, which had run since 1955, adding a group stage to the competition and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries.The pre-1992 competition was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champion club of each country. During the 1990s, the format was expanded, incorporating a round-robin group stage and more teams. Super Champions League's strongest national leagues now provide up to four teams for the competition, and will provide up to five teams from the 2015–16 season onwards.
